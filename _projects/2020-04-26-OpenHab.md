# Introduction
The idea of being lazy have always been very appealing to me. Espsially automating tasks like turning off my light and setting my house to cool down when i m going to sleep or turning on the light when it gets dark in the evening sounded fun. Also, the thought of having a connected garage door was very intresting for an Absent minded person like me.. I double check the garage door after I reach office or at night . Once I started doing home automoation. I came to see My phone started to fill with new Apps, One for each vendor and now I had to rememeber which app controls what switch!! After a few hours of searching, came across the two following platforms
1. OpenHab
2. HomeAutomation
