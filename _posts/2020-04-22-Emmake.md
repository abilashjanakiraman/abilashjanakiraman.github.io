## emmake 
* Looks for a file __makefile__ and executes the commands needed to build the project
* Provides fexibility for different builds to support different browsers

### What are Make files?
* Files that list the rules to build a target
* There are two kinds of statements in a Makefile :
    - Macro Defnitions 
        * Given as __NAME__=__VALUE__
        * Can be accessed as __$(NAME)__
    - Rules
        * The commands and file needed to build for the target
        * Rules have two parts
          _Line 1_: Lists the dependency files and target
          ```makefile
          TARGET_FILE : file1 file2 file3
          ```
          _Line 2_: Shell commands needed to build.
    
* Here is a sample makefile
  ```makefile
  PROJ=helloworld                               #variable PROJ
  CC=emcc                                       #variable CC
  CFLAGS=-O3 --emrun -s WASM=1                  #variable CFLAGS
  $(PROJ).html:$(PROJ).c                        #Rule Line 1
     $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(PROJ).html $(PROJ).c  #Rule Line 2
  ```
  _note_: Make sure to leave a tab in the shell commands

* Special Macros
  - $@ - Make utility will replace the $@ with name of rule's target
  - $^ - Make utility will replace the $^ with the name of dependcies

* Supports Conditions statement.
  ```makefile
  ifeq..else..endif
  ```  
* PHONY targets are used when targets doesnt identify a file.  
  ```makefile
  .PHONY: clean
  clean:
     $(RM) $(PROJ).html $(PROJ).js $(PROJ).wasm 
  ```
